As part of Full Stack Deep Learning 2022, we will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase through the labs to create and deploy a model that understands the content of hand-written paragraphs.

## 1. Lab 0: Overview 
In the first lab, we go through the overview of the text recognizer app that demonstrates core principles and tools of an ML-powered application.
