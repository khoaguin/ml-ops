# Course 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning in Production
In the first course of Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization, we learn to identify the various components and design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modeling strategies, and deployment constraints and requirements; and learn how to establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving a productionized ML application.
