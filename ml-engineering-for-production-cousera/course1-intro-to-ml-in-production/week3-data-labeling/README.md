# Ungraded Lab - Data Labeling
In this ungraded we will learn how the labeling process affects the performance of Machine Learning algorithms and the importance of establishing baselines to measure this change in performance. In particular, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to detect if a Youtube comment is spam or not, and:  
- Define performance baselines using the true labels and random labeling  
- Simulate different labelers that label the data based on different labeling rules    
- Try out your own labeling rules  

Walk throught the file `C1W3_Data_Labeling_Ungraded_Lab.ipynb` to complete the lab.
