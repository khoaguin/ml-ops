# Ungraded Lab - A Journey through Data

## Introduction
In this lab, we will learn the importance of data in deep learning. More specifically, we will do these tasks:
- Manually move images around the filesystem so they are stored in a structure suitable for model training.
- Clean up the dataset as it presents some corrupted images and other issues.
- See how class imbalance negatively affects model evaluation.
- Solve overfitting problems by using Data Augmentation techniques.
