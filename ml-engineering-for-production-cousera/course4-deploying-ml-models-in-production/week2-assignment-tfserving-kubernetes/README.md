# Assignment: Autoscaling TensorFlow Model Deployments with TF Serving and Kubernetes

In this lab, we will learn how to:
- Configure a Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to cluster with an autoscaling node pool.
- Deploy TensorFlow Serving in an autoscalable configuration.
- Monitor serving performance and resource utilization

In particular, we will:
1. Create a GKE cluster with autoscaling enabled on a default node pool
2. Deploy the pretrained ResNet101 model using TensorFlow Serving
3. Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
4. Install Locust
4. Load the ResNet101 model
5. Monitor the model deployment

Follow the instructions in `AutoscalingTFModelDeploymentsWithTFServingAndKubernetes-Qwiklabs.html` to complete the assignment in the Google Cloud Platform environment.
