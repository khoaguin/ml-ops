# Assignment: Implementing Canary Releases of TensorFlow model deployments with Kubernetes and Istio

In this assignment, we will use [Istio](https://istio.io/) on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and TensorFlow Serving to create canary deployments of TensorFlow machine learning models. More concretely, we will:

1. Prepare a GKE cluster with the Istio add-on for TensorFlow Serving.

2. Create a canary release of a TensorFlow model deployment.

3. Configure various traffic splitting strategies.

The assignment is done on the Google Cloud Platform with instructions in the file `CanaryReleases.html`.
