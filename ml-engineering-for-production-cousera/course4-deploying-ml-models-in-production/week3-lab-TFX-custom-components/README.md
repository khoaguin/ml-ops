# Lab: Developing Custom TFX Components
 Tensorflow Extended (TFX) provides ready made components for typical steps in a machine learning workflow. In this lab, we will learn how to construct fully TFX components, which is useful in case our project has specific needs that fall outside the standard TFX components. In particular, we will:
- build a custom component using Python functions
- build a custom component by reusing an existing TFX component
- run a TFX pipeline locally using a built-in pipeline orchestrator
