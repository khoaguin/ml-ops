# Lab: ETL Pipelines and Batch Predictions with Apache Beam and Tensorflow

In this lab, you will create, train, evaluate, and make predictions on a model using Apache Beam and TensorFlow. In particular, you will train a model to predict the molecular energy based on the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms.

The entire pipeline can be divided into four phases:
1. Data extraction
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Training the model
4. Doing predictions
