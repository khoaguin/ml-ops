# Labs: TensorFlow Serving 
**Lab 1 - First look at Tensorflow Serving with Docker (`C4_W1_Lab_2_TFS_Docker.md`)**:  In this lab we will be using TFS to deploy a dummy machine learning model locally.

**Lab 2 - Serve a model with TensorFlow Serving (`C4_W1_Lab_3_TF_Serving.ipynb`)**: 
In this lab we will:
- Learn how to install TF serving.
- Load a pretrained model that classifies dogs, birds and cats.
- Save it following the conventions needed by TF serving.
- Spin a web server using TF serving that will accept requests through HTTP.
- Interact with your model via a REST API.
- Learn about model versioning.
