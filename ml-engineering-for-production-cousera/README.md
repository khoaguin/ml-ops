## About this Specialization
![mlops](./images/mlops-overview.png "the mlops process")
The Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization covers how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production. In striking contrast with standard machine learning modeling, production systems need to handle relentless evolving data. Moreover, the production system must run non-stop at the minimum cost while producing the maximum performance. In this Specialization, we will learn how to use well-established tools and methodologies for doing all of this effectively and efficiently. More specifically, we will learn the components of [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) to deploy production ML pipelines.
