# Assignment: Identifying Bias in Mortgage Data using `Cloud AI Platform` and the `What-if` Tool
In this assignment, we will use the `What-If` Tool to identify potential biases in a model that was trained on a mortgage loan applications dataset. In particular, we will
1. Build a binary classification model using XGBoost.
2. Deploy the model to Cloud AI Platform.
3. Use the What-If Tool on the deployed model to search for biases.

## Environment
We use `Qwiklab` with instruction for Goolgle Cloud Platform in `instructions-qwiklab.html`.
