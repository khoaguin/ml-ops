# Labs: Hyperparameter Tuning & AutoML
**Lab 1 - Intro to Keras Tuner (`C3_W1_Lab_1_Keras_Tuner.ipynb`)**: In this lab, we will practice hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, a package from the Keras team that automates the process of choosing the optimal hyperparameters. We will first train a baseline model with pre-selected hyperparameters, then redo the process with tuned hyperparameters found by Keras Tuner.

**Lab 2 - Hyperparameter tuning and model training with TFX (`C3_W1_Lab_2_TFX_Tuner_and_Trainer.ipynb`)**: In this lab, we will revisit machine learning pipelines using TFX and add two more components: Tuner and Trainer.
