# Labs: Hyperparameter tuning
**Lab 1 - Intro to Keras Tuner (`C3_W1_Lab_1_Keras_Tuner.ipynb`)**: In this lab, we will practice hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, a package from the Keras team that automates the process of choosing the optimal hyperparameters. We will first train a baseline model with pre-selected hyperparameters, then redo the process with tuned hyperparameters found by Keras Tuner.


## Requirements
### Lab 1
`tensorflow==2.8.2`  
`kerastuner==1.0.3`
