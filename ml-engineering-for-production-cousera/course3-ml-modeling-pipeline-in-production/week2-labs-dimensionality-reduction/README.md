# Labs: Dimensionality Reduction
**Lab 1 - Manual Feature Engineering (`C3_W2_Lab_1_Manual_Dimensionality.ipynb.ipynb`)**: 
 In this lab we are going to perform feature engineering using TensorFlow and Keras. In particular, we will:
1. Define the model using feature columns.
2. Use Lambda layers to perform feature engineering on some of these features.
3. Compare the training history and predictions of the model before and after feature engineering.

**Lab 2 -  (`.ipybn`)**: 

## Requirements
### Lab 1
`tensorflow==2.8.2`  
`pandas==1.3.5`

### Lab 2
`tfx==1.3`
