# Assignment: Data Pipeline Components for Production ML

In this assignment, we will carry out the first 3 steps of a production machine learning project - Data ingestion, Data Validation, and Data Transformation.

Specifically, we will build the production data pipeline by:
* Performing feature selection
* Ingesting the dataset
* Generating the statistics of the dataset
* Creating a schema as per the domain knowledge
* Creating schema environments
* Visualizing the dataset anomalies
* Preprocessing, transforming and engineering your features
* Tracking the provenance of the data pipeline using ML Metadata

## Requirements
`tensorflow==2.6.0`  
`tfx==1.3.0`  
`tensorflow_data_validation==1.3.0`  
`tensorflow_transform==1.3.0`
